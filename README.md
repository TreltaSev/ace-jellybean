### Ace Project: Jellybean Website

For quick reference, I had a lot of work to do in other classes so I only had a few hours to work on this an now that its 2am I couldn't be bothered to comment or fix wierd eslint bugs.

This is it this is the website, if needed, I can host it but I don't really think thats necessary.
